# 🐾 Petcom - Landing Page for Pet Care and Adoption

This is a simple and accessible institutional landing page project designed to promote responsible pet care and adoption. The goal is to offer an intuitive and organized interface, developed with a focus on front-end best practices and the application of tools like Gulp for automation.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project was to deepen knowledge and implementation of Gulp, a powerful task automation tool, ensuring efficiency in the development process. Additionally, we incorporated the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for CSS organization and structuring, resulting in clean, modular, and maintainable code.

## 🛠️ Features Implemented with Gulp

For the development of this project, we used Gulp to automate the following tasks:

### 1. **Sass Compilation**
   - Conversion of `.scss` files to `.css` for browser compatibility, leveraging modern Sass features.

### 2. **CSS Minification**
   - Reduction of the final CSS file size by removing spaces, comments, and unnecessary code, improving load times.

### 3. **JS Minification and Obfuscation**
   - Applied minification and obfuscation to JavaScript files, reducing file size and making reverse engineering more difficult.

### 4. **Image Optimization**
   - Compression of images to reduce file size without noticeable quality loss, improving page load times.

### 5. **Image Path Update in HTML**
   - Automated the process of updating image paths in the HTML to reflect changes during file minification and organization.
